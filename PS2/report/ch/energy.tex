In order to decrease the energy consumption of our program we have taken various different methods to reduce the consumption. Instead of using the proposed timer\cite{compendium}, we are instead using the low energy timer, LETIMER0 \cite{EFM32GG-rm}. This timer runs at a lower frequency, but require an low frequency oscillator in order to be of any value. The advantage with this timer is that it uses less energy and is able to run in EM2.
