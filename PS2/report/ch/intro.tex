\section{Introduction}
In this assignment we will use the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board to create different sounds effects. The sound effects is played when buttons on the gamepad controller are pushed. Where each button correspond to a different sound effect. 

The sound effects are realised through the  onboard Digital to Analog converted that is connected to an amplifier. The actual sound is created by waves that are created by oscillations. The frequency, period, and amplitude, of the wave determines the sound. 



%The sound is created by waves that are created by oscillations. The physical sound is created by the properties of this wave. The frequency, period and amplitude of the wave determines the sound. The waves can be created synthetically, by creating a sound synthesiser in software or by using pre-sampled sound waves.  

%Different sounds can be realised by creating different waves of certain frequency and amplitude. The frequency determines the tone and the amplitude determines the strength of the tone. The length of the tone is determined by the period of that particular wave.
