Handling I/O data is essential in nearly all programs. The operations required to do so are often quite complex, but in higher-level programming, this is usually abstracted away by an operating system doing this for you. Without an operating system, one has to manually set up the various timers and interrupt handlers, as well as write the appropriate data to the appropriate registers. This report explains how this was done in an energy-efficient manner on an EFM32GG microcontroller by writing a program using the C programming language.
