\section{Conclusion}
All in all, this has been a very rewarding assignment. Not only have we gotten more experience in programming on microcontrollers, but we have also learned a lot about the process of sound generation through sound synthesis, sampling, and various waveforms, as this was an area where both of the group members had very little experience. Given more time, one area of improvement would be the sampling and sound quality, as this was an area that had to be cut short when the assignment rapidly approached its due date.

%During this assignment we have experimented with different methods of producing sounds. We have mainly experimented with two approaches, sound generation trough software synthesisers and precomputed samples. The main focus have been on generating sounds with some quality, and still achieve low energy consumption. Neither of us have any prior experience with sound theory. This may have affected the music actually generated. The notes generated may therefore not be completely pure.
