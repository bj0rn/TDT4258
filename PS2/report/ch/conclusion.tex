\section{Conclusion}
During this assignment we have experimented with different methods of producing sounds. We have mainly experimented with two approaches, sound generation trough software synthesisers and precomputed samples. The main focus have been on generating sounds with some quality, and still achieve low energy consumption. Neither of us have any prior experience with sound theory. This may have affected the music actually generated. The notes generated may therefore not be completely pure.
