\section{Results and Tests}

\subsection{Energy optimization}
During this assignment we have employed several methods for decreasing the power consumption of the program. We have focused on power consumption of both when the program idle and active. The eAprofiler in the simplicity studio bundle has been used to analyze the power consumption at various stages in the program. For completeness both the power consumptions before and after the an optimization is illustrated through various tests.
