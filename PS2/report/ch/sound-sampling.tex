Sound can also be generated through pre computed samples. With this approach the sound waves are generated on some other platform. The samples produced are approximations to already existing sound samples. The samples are modified slightly to fit the microcontroller. Due to size limitations on the board, 8 bit samples with 8000Hz were generated. This allowed us to be able to play song with some length. In the first approach we generated samples with a sample frequency of 48000Hz. This sample rate produced sounds with relatively high sounds quality, but required a lot of storage for the songs. This limited the lenght of the songs we were able to play.
