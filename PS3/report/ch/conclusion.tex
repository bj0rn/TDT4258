\section{Conclusion}

This has been a very rewarding assignment, as not only have we gotten first-hand experience in developing device drivers using the C programming language, but we have also learned a lot about linux and using the ptxdist build system to build, compile, and flash the microcontroller with the linux file system. Given more time, one main area of improvement would be to create the driver as a platform driver instead, but this was something that had to be cut short when the assignment rapidly approached its due date.

All in all we are quite satisfied with the result, as the driver works and our game is quite intuitive and fun to play and the interaction between the game and the kernel driver are well-defined and tidy.
