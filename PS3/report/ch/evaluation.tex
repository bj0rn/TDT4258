\section{Evaluation}

As neither of the group members had any previous experience with writing linux device drivers, the learning curve for this assignment was quite high. As a result, this ended up being a challenging assignment, but also a very educational one. Getting started was a bit difficult, as there is a lot of information about linux and device drivers in general that had to be indulged, but with patience and good use of the course compendium and the Linux Device Drivers book, the puzzle pieces were eventually put together.

While this was probably the most time-consuming assignment so far in the course, it was also the one with the highest learning outcome. After learning about assembly instructions and programming directly on hardware in the first two assignments, it feels that developing drivers to communicate with hardware was the natural next step in the learning process. We have also learned a lot about the Linux operating system in general and how it can be used as a development platform.
