\subsubsection{Build system}
The system {\bf ptxdist} was used to build the linux system. This system is used to compile the kernel and additional software modules, and create a binary file that can be flashed to the microcontroller. The build process can be divided into two stages, kernel compilation and module compilation. The software developed in this exercise is not integrated in the kernel, so kernel modules were used instead. This implies that it is not needed to re-compile the kernel for every modification, but is instead sufficient to recompile modules themselves with the file system. This ensures a more flexible and time-efficient workflow.
