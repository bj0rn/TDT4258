\subsection{Build system}
In this exercise we use {\bf ptxdist} to build the linux system. The ptxdist system will able us to compile the kernel, and additional software modules, and create a binary file that can be flashed to the microcontroller. The build process can be divided into two stages, kernel compilation and module compilation. The software developed in this exercise is not integrated in the kernel, instead we use kernel modules. This implies that we do not need to re-compile the kernel for every modification. Instead is sufficient to recompile the modules and the file system. 


Root filesystem image, linux kernel image, and bootloader image. This images are independent. Saves time when compiling. Better work flow.
