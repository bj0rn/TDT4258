\section{Introduction}
In this exercise we are going to install linux on the EFM32GG-DK3750 development board and develop a device driver for the gamepad. We will also create a simple game to use the device driver. The game will not access the hardware directly, but instead go through the device driver in the kernel. The driver itself should be developed as a kernel module.
