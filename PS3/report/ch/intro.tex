\section{Introduction}

The description of the exercise was to compile a linux distro called $\mu$Clinux for the EFM32GG-DK3750, write a linux device driver to communicate with an attached gamepad through the linux kernel, and create a game that uses the gamepad through said driver.

The main learning outcome goals of the assignment were to become familiar with linux device drivers and how they are used, as well as become more familiar with the linux operating system and the process involved in compiling the linux kernel. Additional learning outcomes involve increased skills in using the C programming language and how to use said language to create programs with linux as a background operating system.

The command line interface of the program miniterm.py was used to communicate with the board, and an iterative design approach was taken in order to test the program as frequently as possible in order to avoid a complex debugging task at the end of the implementation.
