Operating systems often provide an abstraction for developers to simplify operations such as sending and receiving data. In order to do so for a specific piece of hardware, one needs to use what is called a device driver. This report gives an in-depth explanation of how such a driver was developed for a gamepad on a linux operating system running on an EFM32GG-DK3750 development kit. Also, the report will give an explanation of how this driver was used with an implementation of a simple Pong game. All programming was done using the C programming language.
