\section{Introduction}
{\bf Why is the topic of interest ?}



The goal of the exercise is to design and implement a program that interfaces a gamepad controller. The game pad is connected to the micro controller through the GPIO pins.  





This report takes an iterative approach to achieve energy efficiency. Different methods are evaluated based on their energy consumption. 

The program is implemented on the \emph EFM32GG-DK3750 development board containing an EFM32GG micro controller. This is an ARM based micro controller the designed for low energy consumption. The micro controller allows for many different energy optimizations techniques.
