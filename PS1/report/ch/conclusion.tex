\section{Conclusion}

This proved to be a valuable introduction to understanding low-level SW. As the first couple of years of a computer science programme usually covers mostly high-level programming, the thought of what happens on a hardware level may seem scary and unfamiliar. Previous courses may have covered similar theory in an abstract way, but actually implementing, debugging, and testing such systems gives a much greater educational value, and the knowledge obtained in this assignment will prove to be valuable not only in future assignments, but also for providing an insght regarding the process of going from a higher level program to hardware code.
